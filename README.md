## Description

_A website where users can play a turn-based role-playing game where players fight a CPU. Before they start the game, players may choose their name and select a class. During the game itself, players are given the option to attack, end their turn, or surrender. There is also a random chance for the player or CPU to land a critical hit. The opponent CPU includes randomly selected names and classes. Once either the player or opponent's HP reaches zero, the game is over, and the player can choose to start a new game._
